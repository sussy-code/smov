## Requesting a feature or reporting a bug
There are two places where to request features or report bugs:
 - GitHub Issues
 - The sudo-flix Discord server

### Discord Server
If you do not have a GitHub account or want to discuss a feature or bug with us before making an issue, you can join our Discord server.  
[Join bruh](https://discord.gg/mxhcENzG2j)

### GitHub Issues
To make a GitHub issue for sudo-flix, please visit the [new issue page](https://github.com/sussy-code/smov/issues/new/choose) where you can pick either the "Bug Report" or "Feature Request" template.

When filling out an issue template, please include as much detail as possible and any screenshots or console logs as appropriate.

After an issue is created, it will be assigned either the https://github.com/sussy-code/smov/labels/bug or https://github.com/sussy-code/smov/labels/feature label, along with https://github.com/sussy-code/smov/labels/awaiting-approval. One of our maintainers will review your issue and, if it's accepted, will set the https://github.com/sussy-code/smov/labels/approved label.

## Before you start!
Before starting a contribution, please check your contribution is part of an open issue on [our issues page](https://github.com/sussy-code/smov/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aapproved). 

GitHub issues are how we track our bugs and feature requests that will be implemented into sudo-flix - all contributions **must** have an issue and be approved by a maintainer before a pull request can be worked on.

If a pull request is opened before an issue is created and accepted, you may risk having your pull request rejected! Always check with us before starting work on a feature - we don't want to waste your time!

> **Note**
> The exception to this are language contributions, which are discussed in [this section](#language-contributions)

Also, make sure that the issue you would like to work on has been given the https://github.com/sussy-code/smov/labels/approved label by a maintainer. Otherwise, if we reject the issue, it means your work will have gone to waste!

## Contributing
If you're here because you'd like to work on an issue, amazing! Thank you for even considering contributing to sudo-flix; it means a lot :heart:

Firstly, make sure you've read the [Before you start!](#before-you-start) section!

When you have found a GitHub issue you would like to work on, you can request to be assigned to the issue by commenting on the GitHub issue.

If you are assigned to an issue but can't complete it for whatever reason, no problem! Just let us know, and we will open up the issue to have someone else assigned.
